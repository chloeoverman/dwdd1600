            <h2 id="EllenRipley">Ellen Ripley</h2>
            
            <p>In the first four movies we follow the story of Ellen Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver. Ripley is a civilian adviser and warrant officer of the US Marine Corps. She is from the Olympia colony on the Luna mood settlement. And is the mother to a single daughter named Amanda. In the first movie we see Ripley assigned to a commerical freight team the USCSS Nostromo as an officer. During this mission, the crew becomes compromised after a alien lifeform infects one of the members. After a long harrowing struggle, Ripleys entire crew is killed by the Xenomorph alien, leaving her as the sole survivor of the incident. After destroying the Nostromo to kill the alien, Ellen ends up getting stuck in hypersleep in her escape pod for 57 years before she is found. By the time she was found her daughter Amanda had passed, leaving Ellen with permanent emotional trauma. Yet her experience fighting the Xenomorph alien made her a key part of the later movies, as they tried to use her knowledge to kill the creature.</p>
            
            <h2>Xenomorph</h2>
            <p>The Xenomorph or "alien" is a parasitic species that uses a living host in order to develop through different metamorphosis stages. This creature has been deemed a perfect species and very difficult to kill. It starts its cycle as an egg or "Ovomorph" which lies dormant until it senses a host is nearby. These eggs are laid by the Queen Xenomorph similar to bees or ants and work in a hive like structure. When the host is present the egg opens and releases the next phase called the facehugger. This phase consists of a creature that measure around 8 feet long and a nude pale color; the main body portion resembles two fused handlike structures and a long tail simlar to a horseshoe crab. During this phase, it scurries around on its fingerlike arms having to rely on stealth and speed in order to ambush its host. It traps its host by using its hand like appendages to grab its face and use its tail to wrap around its neck with extreme strength, "hugging" the victims face which is where its name comes from. Once latched it implants the chestburster into the torso of the host, and uses lung like sacs to breathe during implanation. Removing the alien during this phase is almost always fatal, due to the creature having acid blood that is corrosive, and will restrict the airway of the host with its tail if pryed off suffocating the victim. The third and most gruesome phase is the chestburster. Once implanted in the chest, the facehugger will fall off and die, and the host will go back to seemingly normal or even feeling better than before implantation. During this period the alien is developing within the victims body similar to a pregnancy until it is ready to burst through the hosts chest killing it. It does this by using an enzyme that softens the bones and other structures around it so it can force its way through the chest. Once outside of the host it looks snake like with underdeveloped arms, and a large head with razor sharp teeth, using its tail to propel itself around. This is the most vunerable stage of their lifecycle, so most often they will hide after leaving the hosts body, until it is a fully developed adult. The first three phases of the Xenomorph cycle are the same up until the adult phase. Depending on the host the adults can vary in different functions and looks, but the most common adult phase is the Drone, which is also the most famouly known and recognizable from the series. The drone measures roughly 8 feet in height and has a 16 foot long tail, and has a slick black skin and usually stand in bipedal stature similar to humans. They have elongated heads with two mouths a larger one and a smaller projectile mouth that has enough force to break bones. They are notriously deadly with extreme agility and strength. They also have on the end of their tail has a blade like tip that they use to strike and strangle their enemies. Not only do they have all of these characteristcs but they also have pressurized acid blood, so if injured or killed they often get their blood on their prey melting their tissues.</p>
