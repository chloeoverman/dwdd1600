            <h2>Where It Was Filmed</h2>
            <p>The Aliens movie franchise was filmed at the Shepperton Studios in Shepperton, England. The Shepperton Studio was eventually bought by Ridley Scott and his brother in 1995, later merging it with the Pinewood Studio in nearby London. Here some of the biggest films of all time have been created. The physical set was divided into three full sized portions creating a maze like structure, this is the internal portion of the ship where most of the in person filming took place. This was created with the help of over 200 artists and designers. The main designer behind the interior sets is Ron Cobb, an artists, designer and film director, known for many famous movies including Star Wars IV, Back to the Future and more. Ron also helped create the minature ships used in the in flight sequences via tiny models. Another famous artists involved with the production of  the Aliens design is H.R. Geiger. Geiger was involved in the creature design for the series, making the famous monster we know today. He not only created the Xenomorph but also multiple stages of their life cycle including the facehugger and egg. Geiger won an academy award for visual effect from his designs in this series.</p>
